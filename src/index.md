**ScriptSense** is a project-aware static analysis and workflow tool for Roblox Studio, designed to bring professional-grade tooling to Luau development. It enhances the Roblox Script Editor with intelligent automation and real-time safety tools. It understands what you type, prevents broken references, and keeps your workflow clean and fast without getting in the way.

## Why ScriptSense?
- **Type Safety**
: Catch bugs before you run your game with live type checking.
- **Workflow Automation**
: Automate repetitive tasks with custom macros and commands.
- **Project Awareness**
: Understands your entire project, not just individual scripts.

## Key Features
- **Live-Analysis**
: Deep analysis of your codebase to find errors, style issues, and potential performance bottlenecks.
- **Safety**
: Built for safety, using robust checks to handle edge cases, requiring user conformity to execute tasks carefully, and providing the ability to undo (and redo) actions.
- **Extensibility**
: Write your own rules, macros, and commands to tailor ScriptSense to your, and your team's workflow.
